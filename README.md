# stub

_A tool for generating stubs for open and closed source libraries_

## Instalation

TODO

## Usage

To generate stubs you need to pass the `classpath` and at least one namespace from `namespaces` to `stub` later require it and find all related namespaces for stub generation.
You can specify a optional `output-dir`, otherwise the `stubs` folder will be used.
For more details check `stub --help`.

### CLI

`stub --classpath ".../clojure.jar:/foo/bar.jar" --namespaces foo.bar`

`stub -c ".../clojure.jar:/foo/bar.jar" -n foo.bar -o /tmp/stubs`

### API

TODO

## How does it work

This tool first create a temporary file with a custom clojure code, then shell out a java process with the specified classpath calling the code from the created temporary file which should get all necessary metadata and then finish, which stub should then create all files from that metadata.

## Develop

Run `clj -M:run generate -c "<your-classpath> -n some.entrypoint-ns"`
